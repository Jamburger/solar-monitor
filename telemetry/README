These scripts for receiving and processing telemetry from the solar monitor.

collect.py: Receives serialized messages from /dev/ttyUSB0 at 57600 baud. These
  parameters are hardcoded (ick!), but they can be changed. Battery potential,
  solar current, and solar potential telemetry are expected, with types 0, 1,
  and 2, respectively. Each is vectored to its own two-column output file
  ("battery_potential", "solar_current", and "solar_potential", respectively),
  where the second column is the measurement and the first column is the current
  Unix epoch time in seconds.

  Usage: $ ./collect.py

smooth.py: Many readings suffered from low-period oscillation, probably due to
  capacitance on the ADC pins. This script performs a configurable moving
  average on a column of data and spits out the results. This has the effect of
  low-pass filtering the data.

  Usage: To smooth the solar current file over 20 samples and write the output
         column to solar_current_smoothed_20, do:

         $ cat solar_current | awk '{print $2}' | ./smooth.py 20 > \
           solar_current_smoothed_20
